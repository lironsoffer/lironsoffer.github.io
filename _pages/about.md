I am an M.Sc. student in Industrial Engineering at [Tel Aviv University](https://www.tau.ac.il), advised by [Dr. Chen Shani](https://sites.google.com/mail.huji.ac.il/dr-chen-shani). My research focuses on interpretability and concept understanding in large language models, specifically, how LLMs represent and compress meaning compared to human cognition.

Our paper [_From Tokens to Thoughts: How LLMs and Humans Trade Compression for Meaning_](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17117) (with Chen Shani, Dan Jurafsky, Yann LeCun, and Ravid Shwartz-Ziv) has been accepted to **ICLR 2026**.

Before my M.Sc., I spent five years at [Sunbit](https://sunbit.com) as an AI/ML engineer and later Risk Team Lead, where I built production ML systems for financial risk and led a GenAI innovation team. I hold a B.Sc. in Industrial Engineering – Business Information Systems from the [Technion](https://www.technion.ac.il).
